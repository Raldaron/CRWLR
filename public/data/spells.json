It can only be cast a total of 3 times. \n\nThis spell has been cast 0 times so far. \n\nAt level 5, the casting of War Crime requires you to choose two spells in your arsenal. It will \nthen combine these two spells in a creative way. The spells will always do what they’re \nsupposed to do, but it may happen in a fun, exciting, and unpredictable manner. Intention \nmatters, and for this spell, we respect that.

It’ll live up to the spell’s name. \n\nI’ll make sure of that. \n\nThree notes: One. Once you cast this, your health will be knocked down to 1%. \n\nTwo. You will lose access to the two spells for the remainder of the floor, but you will now \nbe able to—optionally—chain those same two spells together and cast them \nsimultaneously for the price of just one on later floors. All spells added to the mix during \nfurther castings of War Crime will be able to mix and match with one another, either all or in \npart. \n\nAnd finally, Warning. No matter what happens to your targets physically, this spell can’t kill \nanyone directly. No matter what happens to them, they will not die from this spell. They will \nwant to die. They won’t. Even if the chosen spells results in them being chopped into \npieces, liquified, and spewed across the playing field into multiple puddles, they will not \ndie. You should probably have a finisher on hand if that’s your intention. As far as I’m \nconcerned, I think it’ll be funnier if you leave them alive. But you do you. \n\nSo, what happens when you actually cast this? Let’s give an example from the one and only \ntime this spell has ever been used in Dungeon Crawler World. \n\nThe Operatic warlord who cast this decided to combine two spells on a group of \ncharging soldiers from the mantid team: Fireball and Paralysis. Not very creative, but it \nworked. He was parked atop a circle of power at the time, and the spell cast in a wide \narc, hitting approximately 200 mercenaries for the mantids at once. There was only \none true mantis in the bunch, and she noped out of the game all together by ejecting \napproximately ten seconds after getting hit. \n\nThe victims were paralyzed permanently. They were set on fire permanently. They were \neach blown off in an arc away from the caster where they didn’t stop until they hit \nsomething. For some of those poor mercenaries, that was very, very far. They remained \nthere, paralyzed and on fire and undying for the remainder of the floor. The caster of the \nspell received an experience point update for every hour or so of their suffering.\n\nIncidentally, the wuss of an AI in charge of that season decided to put the on-fire NPC \nmercenaries out of their misery once the floor finally collapsed about two weeks later. \n\nAdditional fun fact. The Operatic who cast the spell supposedly had to go for an identity \nreset after the crawl and was re-absorbed. Part of his essence eventually formed \ninto Hortense Leadership Unit. I’d like to think that’s why he has a twitch to him. Collective \nminds should really have learned by now how to peel off their own... impurities. Otherwise \nyou’re just wallowing in used bath water, if you know what I’m saying.",
      "effectdescription": "War Crime is a horrific spell that creates nightmarish combinations of other spells, \nresulting in permanent, torturous effects that cannot directly kill targets but leave them in \nperpetual agony and distress. \n\nWhen cast, the caster selects spells from their arsenal (two spells at level 5, three at level \n10, four at level 15) that must be at least level 8. These spells are combined in \nunpredictable, creative ways to create a devastating effect that strikes targets in a cone \nemanating from the caster's eyes. \n\nThe spell has several important limitations and effects:\n\n Immediately reduces the caster's health to 1% upon casting \n Can only be cast once per floor, and only on Scolopendra Levels (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18) \n Can only be cast a total of 3 times \n The caster loses access to the combined spells for the remainder of the floor \n Targets cannot die directly from the spell's effects, no matter how gruesome\n Effects are permanent until the floor ends\n\nAfter casting, the combined spells gain a synergy - they can be chain-cast for the cost of a \nsingle spell on future floors, and all spells used in War Crime can be mixed and matched \nwith each other.",

Once dead, the rest of the victim burns away, and the Flesher \ncasts the only spell it knows. Boned, which animates the remaining skeleton. \n\nThe creature that eventually forms is no longer a minion to the original mage. Nor is it \nundead. It is new to the world, oftentimes confused and afraid. And weak. The Symbiote is \nvery easy to kill. After a few hours have passed and the new Symbiote is complete, the \ncombined creature becomes a target for other Fleshers, who are said to be drawn to their \nformer companion’s new bones.
